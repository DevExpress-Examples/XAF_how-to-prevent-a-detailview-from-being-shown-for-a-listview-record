# XAF - How to prevent a Detail View from being shown for a List View record

## Scenario

For certain data forms, a developer needs to limit end-users toÂ editing only through the List View, i.e. without invoking a separate Detail View. This is usually done by activatingÂ the inline editingÂ and `MasterDetailMode` = `ListViewAndDetailView` features as described in the following article: [List View Edit Modes](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113249/ui-construction/views/list-view-edit-modes).

## Implementation Details

To accomplish this task, access the [ListViewProcessCurrentObjectController class](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.SystemModule.ListViewProcessCurrentObjectController) using the [Frame.GetController<ControllerType>() method](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.Frame.GetController--1) and disable the ListViewProcessCurrentObjectController.ProcessCurrentObjectAction.

## Additional Information

This article covers only the case when a Detail View is shown from the List View after a User double-clicks or presses Enter key on a record. Other scenarios should be handled separately by extending the code of this controller.

For example, if you do not want to show a Detail View after a new object is created via the New Action, you can handle the `NewObjectViewController.ObjectCreating` event and set its `ObjectCreatingEventArgs.ShowDetailView` property to `false`. However, this is outside the purpose of this article.
